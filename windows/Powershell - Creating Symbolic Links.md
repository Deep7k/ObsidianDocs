## Introduction

Symbolic links, also known as symlinks or soft links, are pointers or shortcuts to files or directories. They can be useful for various reasons, such as linking files across different directories or creating shortcuts to important resources.

This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to create symbolic links using PowerShell on Windows.
## Prerequisites

- Access to a Windows machine with administrative privileges.
- Basic familiarity with PowerShell commands.
## Steps

### 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator

   - Right-click on the **Start** menu and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
### 2. Determine the Target and Destination

   - Identify the file or directory you want to link to (target) and where you want the link to appear (destination).
### 3. Create a Symbolic Link

- Use the `New-Item` cmdlet with the `-ItemType SymbolicLink` parameter to create a symbolic link.
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "C:\path\to\destination\linkName" -Target "C:\path\to\target\fileOrFolder"
```

- Example:
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\LinkToFolder" -Target "D:\Data\ImportantFolder"
```
### 4. Verify the Symbolic Link

- To verify that the symbolic link was created successfully, you can use:
```powershell
Get-Item "C:\path\to\destination\linkName"
```
This will show details about the symbolic link, including its target.
### 5. Use the Symbolic Link

- Once created, you can use the symbolic link just like any other file or directory. It will point to the target location.

## Conclusion

You have successfully created a symbolic link using PowerShell on your Windows machine. Symbolic links are powerful tools for managing file and directory structures efficiently.
